### The Odin Project: *HTML-CSS Project*
 
**The Odin Project's** [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

A [**mock site**](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/meta-morphosis/google-homepage/blob/master/index.html) of Google's homepage,

There are a few *issues* currently such as sloppy design and lack of technique which means the site might be/is displayed differently across different operating systems. Looking forward to fixing these issues.

Designed on *Win***10**
